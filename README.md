# Loan-Repayment-Prediction 
# Loan Repayment Prediction using XGBoost

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a borrower will repay a loan using machine learning techniques.  
A binary classification model was developed using **XGBoost** on a structured financial dataset from the **Kaggle Tabular Playground Series 2025**.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To build a machine learning model that predicts loan repayment outcomes (`loan_paid_back`) based on borrower and loan-related features.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Kaggle Tabular Playground Series 2025
- Type: Structured financial dataset (synthetically generated)
- Records: Thousands of rows with multiple numerical and categorical features

---

## 🧠 Methodology
1. Data loading and initial exploration  
2. Data preprocessing and cleaning  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Encoding categorical variables  
3. Feature engineering  
4. Model training using **XGBoost Classifier**  
5. Model evaluation using:
   - Accuracy Score  
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
